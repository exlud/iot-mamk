# Description

Modify the program from the previous exercise by calculating the floating average of five consecutive
temperatures. Print the result to the OLED display once per second.

Hint: Save the values into an array or list with 5 elements. Look into how you can pop the first item of a list to
always have the 5 newest values stored.
