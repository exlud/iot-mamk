# Description

Create a program that blinks the on-board LED to show the SOS sequence in Morse code.

Each long character (dah) should last for 1500ms while each short character (dit) should last for 500ms. There should be a 500ms break between characters and a 1500ms break between letters. After each message, there should be a 3500ms break and board should start showing the SOS code again.
