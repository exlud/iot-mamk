# Description

Write a program that asks the user to input a Pokémon ID number between 1 and 1025. The number is used to
fetch the name of the Pokémon corresponding to the ID number. The Pokémon names are fetched from PokéAPI
at https://pokeapi.co/. Use the pokemon-species endpoint for the API calls. Documentation for the endpoints can
be found here: https://pokeapi.co/docs/v2.
